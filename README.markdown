## What is "Maven Template POM"? ##

I prefer Gradle to Maven. However many JEE clients still prefer Maven (understandable).

Maven grew to be an unnecessary complex beast, that I have to relearn every time I come back to it.

This POM is just a copy/paste template that already have some dependencies cooked into it:

+  Spring Batch
+  Spring Core, JDBC, Test
+  Spock + Maven Plugin
+  DbUnit
+  Hazelcast
+  Logback

But whenever you have a choice: "Go Gradle!"
